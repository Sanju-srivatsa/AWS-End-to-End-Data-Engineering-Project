# Cloud Data Pipeline Mastery: End-to-End Analytics with AWS
---
## Abstract
This project, titled "Cloud Data Pipeline Mastery: End-to-End Analytics with AWS," focuses on building a versatile and scalable data engineering pipeline using AWS services to analyze and visualize any dataset. For this implementation, we used the Spotify dataset, but the architecture is designed to accommodate any dataset, making it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications in data-driven decision-making. By leveraging AWS Glue, S3, Athena, and QuickSight, this project provides an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution for processing and analyzing data, offering valuable insights to stakeholders.

## Introduction
In this project, we will build a comprehensive data engineering pipeline using AWS cloud services. While we demonstrate the pipeline with the Spotify dataset, the project architecture is flexible enough to handle any dataset. The focus is on processing and analyzing data using various AWS tools like S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.

## Project Architecture Overview
- **Staging Layer**: Raw data is stored in an S3 bucket.
- **ETL Pipeline**: AWS Glue processes and transfers data from the staging layer to the data warehouse.
- **Data Warehouse**: Processed data is stored in another S3 bucket.
- **Data Catalog**: AWS Glue Crawler creates a database and tables for the data warehouse.
- **Data Analysis**: AWS Athena queries the processed data.
- **Data Visualization**: AWS QuickSight visualizes the data.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account
- Basic understanding of AWS services like S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight

## AWS Services Used
- **Amazon S3**: For storing raw and processed data.
- **AWS Glue**: For building and managing ETL pipelines.
- **AWS Athena**: For querying data using SQL-like syntax.
- **AWS QuickSight**: For visualizing data.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the [Spotify Dataset 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tonygordonjr/spotify-dataset-2023) available on Kaggle. The dataset, created by Tony Gordon Jr., includes detailed information about Spotify albums, artists, tracks, and various audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, and more. Although this project uses the Spotify dataset, the pipeline is designed to be dataset-agnostic.

## Data Description
- **Albums**: Contains details of all the albums, including album ID, name, popularity, and release date.
- **Artists**: Contains information about the artists, including their names, number of followers, and genres.
- **Tracks**: Contains track-level data, including track ID, popularity, and other features like danceability and energy.
- **Spotify Features**: Contains various audio features like loudness, mode, speechiness, and valence.

## Project Implementation

### Setting Up AWS IAM User
In this step, we create an IAM user in AWS with specific permissions required for the project. The user will have access to S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight services. This ensures that the user has the necessary roles to interact with AWS services securely.

### Creating S3 Buckets
We set up S3 buckets to store raw and processed data. The `staging` folder in the S3 bucket will hold the raw data files, while the `data-warehouse` folder will store the processed data. This separation ensures organized storage and easy retrieval of data at different stages of the pipeline.

### Setting Up AWS Glue for ETL
AWS Glue is used to create a data pipeline that automates the process of extracting data from the `staging` folder, transforming it by joining and cleaning the data, and then loading it into the `data-warehouse` folder. This step highlights the power of Glue in managing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations seamlessly.

### Creating a Data Catalog with AWS Glue Crawler
AWS Glue Crawler scans the processed data in the `data-warehouse` folder and automatically creates a data catalog, which consists of databases and tables. This catalog allows for easier querying and management of data within AWS, enabling structured data analysis.

### Querying Data with AWS Athena
In this step, we use AWS Athena to run SQL queries on the processed data stored in S3. Athena allows us to perform interactive queries directly on the data, providing valuable insights without the need for complex infrastructure. The query results are stored in a designated S3 bucket for further analysis.

### Visualizing Data with AWS QuickSight
Finally, we connect AWS QuickSight to Athena to visualize the data. QuickSight offers an intuitive interface to create charts, graphs, and dashboards based on the processed data. These visualizations can be shared with stakeholders, providing them with actionable insights from the data.
